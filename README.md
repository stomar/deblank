deblank - remove special characters from filenames
==================================================

`deblank` is a command line tool (written in [Ruby][Ruby])
that renames files and replaces or removes special characters
like spaces, parentheses, or umlauts.
The new filename will only contain the following characters:

    A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -

Spaces are replaced by underscores, German umlauts and eszett are
transliterated, all other invalid characters are removed.

Examples
--------

Use the program as shown in the examples below.

* `deblank "no space (and parentheses) allowed.txt"`

    renames the file to `no_space_and_parentheses_allowed.txt`

* `deblank "path with spaces/schr√∂dinger.jpg"`

    renames the file to `path with spaces/schroedinger.jpg`

* `deblank -n "no space.txt"`

    no-act mode, only shows what would happen

* `deblank -l`

    lists the used character substitutions
